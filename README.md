# Prework - Color Changer

Submitted by: Perrin Alaine-Sedano

Color Changer is a highly complex app using cutting-edge technologies that allow you to change its background and text colors to a randomized value at the press of a button. Not only that, but you can also reset them to the defaults.

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [✓] Users see a screen with three labels and a button
- [✓] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

  - Search saved logins and notes

My App Idea: I would like to build an organization/notes app where the user grows a tree containing their thoughts, ideas, projects, etc. Each branch represents a specific category and they can add notes within that category as leaves or sub-branches. So, for example, there could be one branch labelled "Work" with sub-branches for "Meetings", "Projects", and "Reminders." There could be another branch labelled "School" with sub-branches for classes, and leaves on those branches representing notes from individual class sessions. Users would be able to write, draw, and upload different file types to the leaves and branches. The tree should be visually appealing with optional customizations available like adding vines, flowers, and birds. That way, the app can be fun as well as useful. I would have to design it carefully so the decorative elements aren't too distracting. In addition, there could be a feature to mark tasks as complete or incomplete and set a time limit. Branches could start to visibly "wilt" if too many tasks aren't completed in time, and get better once they are marked off.

## Notes

The biggest challenge when building this app was navigating XCode's menus and linking to Github.
